# Project Decision Tool [Under Development]

This CakePHP application receives text, audio, or video pitches, and lets you set statuses on these pitches.  You can easily look at the pitch, change its status, or remove it from your project tool all together.  You can also append files to each project, and label the files.  This is not a project management tool, but rather a tool to help you decide on projects.  It is also a great place to store files for your projects.
